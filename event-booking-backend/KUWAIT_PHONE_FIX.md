# Kuwait Phone Number Validation Fix

## Problem

The admin approval process was failing when trying to approve join requests from Kuwait users because the phone validation was only accepting Jordan phone numbers. Additionally, Kuwait users couldn't login via OTP because the OTP controller was only handling Jordan phone numbers.

**Admin Approval Error:**

```
Approval Error: Error: User validation failed: phone: +96599141518 is not a valid Jordan phone number!
```

**OTP Login Error:**

```
Send OTP Error: Error: Invalid Jordan phone number format
```

## Root Cause

The User model was using Jordan-only phone validation, but the system needed to support both Jordan and Kuwait phone numbers after expanding the service to Kuwait.

## Solution

### 1. Updated User Model (`models/User.js`)

- **Phone Validation**: Changed from Jordan-only validation to support both Jordan and Kuwait phone numbers
- **Country Field**: Added a `country` field to track which country the user is from
- **Pre-save Middleware**: Updated to automatically detect country based on phone number prefix and apply appropriate standardization

### 2. Updated JoinRequest Model (`models/JoinRequest.js`)

- **Country Field**: Added a `country` field to store the user's country during join requests

### 3. Updated Join Controller (`controllers/joinController.js`)

- **User Creation**: Modified to include the country field when creating new users from join requests
- **User Updates**: Added country field updates when converting existing users to suppliers

### 4. Fixed OTP Controller (`controllers/otpController.js`)

- **Phone Standardization**: Updated both `sendOtp` and `verifyOtp` functions to use automatic phone standardization
- **Country Detection**: Added automatic detection of Kuwait vs Jordan phone numbers

### 5. Enhanced Phone Utils (`utils/phoneUtils.js`)

- **Display Formatting**: Updated `formatPhoneForDisplay` function to handle both Jordan and Kuwait phone number formats
- **Auto-Detection**: Added `standardizePhoneAuto` function that automatically detects and standardizes phone numbers based on format

## Technical Details

### Phone Number Formats Supported

#### Jordan Numbers

- **Pattern**: `+9627[789]XXXXXXX`
- **Examples**: `+962791234567`, `0791234567`, `791234567`
- **Display Format**: `(079) 123-4567`

#### Kuwait Numbers

- **Pattern**: `+965[569]XXXXXXX`
- **Examples**: `+96599141518`, `099141518`, `99141518`
- **Display Format**: `(991) 415-18`

### Validation Logic

```javascript
// New validation in User model
validator: function(phone) {
  return isValidJordanPhone(phone) || isValidKuwaitPhone(phone);
}
```

### Country Detection

```javascript
// Automatic country detection in pre-save middleware
if (this.phone.startsWith("+965")) {
  this.country = "kuwait";
  this.phone = standardizeKuwaitPhone(this.phone);
} else {
  this.country = "jordan";
  this.phone = standardizePhoneByCountry(this.phone, "jordan");
}
```

## Testing

Created and ran a comprehensive test script that verified:

- ✅ Jordan phone number validation and formatting
- ✅ Kuwait phone number validation and formatting
- ✅ Mixed validation (both countries)
- ✅ Various input formats (with/without country code, with/without +)

## Impact

- **Fixed**: Admin approval process now works for Kuwait users
- **Fixed**: OTP login now works for Kuwait users
- **Enhanced**: System now supports both Jordan and Kuwait phone numbers
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing Jordan users are not affected
- **Future Ready**: Easy to add more countries by extending the phone utils
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects country based on phone number format

## Files Modified

1. `models/User.js` - Updated phone validation and added country field
2. `models/JoinRequest.js` - Added country field
3. `controllers/joinController.js` - Updated user creation logic
4. `controllers/otpController.js` - Fixed OTP authentication for Kuwait numbers
5. `utils/phoneUtils.js` - Enhanced display formatting and added auto-detection

## Migration Notes

- Existing users will have `country: "jordan"` by default
- New users will have their country automatically detected based on phone number
- No database migration required for existing data
